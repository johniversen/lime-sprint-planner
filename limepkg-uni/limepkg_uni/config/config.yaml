# Here you can define limetypes to be presented.
# The structure is as follows:
# limetypes:
#   example_limetype: 
#     presentation_alias: database_key
#
# The presentation alias is the name by which the variable is displayed in the app.
# These can be named whatever you'd like, with the exception of these special keywords: 
#   DisplayName       - The string that will be displayed in the list of limetypes. (required)
#                       This string is defined directly here in the config, 
#                       so unlike the other fields in the config it will 
#                       not retrieve a field from the DB.  
#   PriorityVariable  - Determines what variable decides priority.                  (optional)
#                       If no priority is set, all cards will simply be displayed
#                       in a single row. 
#   PriorityHierarchy - List of possible values from 'PriorityVariable'             (optional)
#                       that decide priority. Each value should contain 
#                       a unique number afterwards that decides its priority.
#                       (position on the x axis of the board, 1 being the leftmost)
#   Card:             - Defines title, optional text and custom fields for the card.(required)
#     CardTitle       - Becomes the title (header) of the card.                     (required)
#     Comment         - Displayed underneath the header of the card.                (optional) 
#   AdditionalInfo:   - Defines what fields will be displayed on the dialog that    (optional)
#                       opens when users click on a card. 
#     Priority:       - If this variable returns 'urgent' from the db, a fire icon  (optional) 
#                       will be displayed on the card. (if placed in AdditionalInfo)
#                       (originally hardcoded for the solutionmprovement limetype)
#
#   Optional:         - Contains optional fields that add functionality frontend.   (optional)
#                       Currently only contains the 'Date Deadline' field/option.
#     Date Deadline   - Will display a weekpicker on the frontend if defined.       (optional)
#                       Limetypes without this field will default to displaying
#                       all cards at the same time. Limetypes with the Date Deadline
#                       field set will have the option to only display limetypes 
#                       with a deadline set within the selected week.
#   
# Restrictions: (TODO: Fix)
# There are currently some  restrictions on how data is retrieved and displayed: 
#     DateTime   - DateTime variables must be prefixed with 'Date ' in order to be 
#                  formatted correctly. eg. 'Date Done'.
#     Duplicates - The database-api does not handle duplicates, and will not return
#                  the same variable under two different aliases. This means that 
#                  we can not use a variable both as status and as secondary_text
#                  for example.
